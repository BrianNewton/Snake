# Snake
## By Brian Newton
### June 2017

This project was created for my grade 11 Computer science course summative project.

This is an implementation of Snake, created using JavaFX, the user controls a snake which can move in two dimensions. The object of the game is too eat as much fruit as possible to grow. The game is lost if the snake collides with either itself or a wall.

There are three difficulty options in the game, the distinction between the three being in the time each frame of the animation takes.
